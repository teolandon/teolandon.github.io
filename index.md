I'm Theo Kalfas (aka teolandon), and I'm an aspiring software developer,
currently studying in Grinnell College, IA, for my Bachelor's Degree in CS. I
enjoy getting involved in various projects and helping out with development.

Feel free to contact me or browse through my GitHub. I'd be happy to talk!

I begin work at [Source Allies](https://www.sourceallies.com/) in June 2018.
